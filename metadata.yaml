description: Alan Thurston was an immunologist at Midwestern University Medical School.
  Like most men in the teaching trade, he also had a research project. If it worked
  out, he'd be one of the great names in medicine; like Jenner, Pasteur, and Salk.
  But it didn't work. Quite the opposite, and the disease he created the ravaged the
  human race.
